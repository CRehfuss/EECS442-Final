# EECS442-Final
Repo for our EECS 442 - Computer Vision Final Project. A text recognition/translator project.

You can run bounding boxes by running " python get_bounding_boxes.py " on your terminal.

This will open up a file finder window. Open the image you want to upload. Then toggle to the plot window opened by python.

You can click and drag over each letter in the image. Once you've dragged over every letter hit submit. This will run predict.py.

A new window will pop up where you can select the language you want to translate the word into. The translated word will print onto the terminal.
